# Medicine-Expiry-Checker
The idea behind this project was to save the public health and money. Every year only in UK alone, 
tens of millions pounds worth of medicine is wasted just because of proper expiry checking systems 
are not deployed in the medicine stores and pharmacies. To eradicate those challenging issues, this 
Expiry Checker App would be beneficial as it displays the medication expiry 
time line along with the stock status and a brief profile.
